# Start-up Ideas
## Climate Team
* All startup ideas, vision, mission, strategy, plans, timelines and all relevant documentation for an upcoming organisation called [Climate Team](http://climate-team.com)
* For some strange reason, even though Adobe created the PDF file format, Adobe Acrobat cannot open PDF files that are larger than 200 inches apparently (Error message: The dimensions of this page are out of range. Page content might be truncated!) for some strange reason!
* The included PDF files open and preview on the built-in PDF viewer called Preview on MacOS with no issues. The same also seems to be the case with Nitro PDF viewer. This indicates that this issue is isolated to Adobe PDF products. This hasn't been tested on Windows/Linux OSes yet.

Current Suggestion is to download this alternative free PDF viewer instead: [Nitro PDF](https://www.gonitro.com)

### Project Timeline:
* Is created using a tool called [Aeon Timeline](https://timeline.app) (available for MacOS and Windows)
* Alternatively, this can be downloaded for free when bundled with a paid [SetApp](http://setapp.com) subscription on MacOS
